        Some men never think of it. 
        You did. You’d come along 
        And say you’d nearly brought me flowers 
        But something had gone wrong.
        
        The shop was closed. Or you had doubts — 
        The sort that minds like ours 
        Dream up incessantly. You thought 
        I might not want your flowers.
        
        It made me smile and hug you then.
        Now I can only smile.
        But, look, the flowers you nearly brought 
        Have lasted all this while.</b></pre>

    <h4 id="a3" class="cen">Chess</h4>
    <p class="cen">
        Playing chess improves brain function because the<br> 
        player uses his or her brain's left hemisphere which<br>
         deals with recognition of objects, and right hemisphere <br>
         which deals with recognition of patterns. Playing chess improves<br>
          memory by adopting the strategies and tacties used for good gaming experience.
